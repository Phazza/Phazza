- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phazza
- 👀 I’m interested in AI - I'm a patent attorney by profession, but I'm interested in tech (a) for fun and (b) because of my profession.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and I've done many courses to start to develop a good foundation on which I can build when protecting clients' inventions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything - Who is my teacher?  Anyone willing to share knowledge with a view to building one another up.
- 📫 How to reach me reetmon007ai@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm too old for that - I'm a bloke
- ⚡ Fun fact: Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, and started playing table tennis again after a 30 yr break!
